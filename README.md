# Sam Barham's Emacs Configuration

This repository contains my standard `init.el`, which I use to configure Emacs across various environments. It's intended to make it easier for me to quickly set up Emacs on new machines, particularly when working on remote servers.

I've made the repo public, because I think having ready access to reasonable Emacs configurations is a fine way to help beginners get started developing in Emacs without having to do quite as much legwork. Emacs is big, and complex, and beautiful; but it's perhaps well not to try and delve into *all* of its complexity *all at once*. Best to start somewhere, and then edit and modify as one learns.

## Installation Instructions

### Installing Emacs

Depending on your environment, you can install Emacs in different ways:

#### 1. Without `sudo` Privileges (Using Conda)

If you do not have `sudo` privileges, you can install Emacs using [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/). First, ensure you have Conda installed, and then use `conda-forge` to install Emacs:

```bash
conda install conda-forge::emacs
```

#### 2. With `sudo` Privileges (Using OS Package Manager)

If you have `sudo` privileges on the machine in question, the easiest way to install Emacs is through your operating system's package manager. For example, on Ubuntu or other Debian-based systems, you might run:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install emacs
```

You can replace `apt` with the appropriate package manager for your system (e.g., `yum`, `dnf`, or even `brew` for macOS).

## Configuring Emacs

Once you have Emacs installed, you can set it up minimally with the provided `init.el` file from this repository.

### Quick Setup:

1. First clone this repository:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:sbarham/emacs-config.git
```

2. Now copy the `init.el` file to your Emacs configuration directory:

```bash
cp emacs-config/init.el ~/.emacs.d/init.el
```

3. Launch Emacs, and your configuration will automatically be applied.

Enjoy your Emacs setup!

## Common Issue with Conda Installations (Emacs v28+)

If you're installing Emacs via Conda (especially versions 28 and 29â€”currently on v29.3 at the time of writing), you may encounter an error like this:

```
Wrong type argument: filenamep, "/scratch2/software/anaconda/envs/emacs/share/info^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^\

^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@^@/" [24 times]
```

This is likely due to a corrupted `INFOPATH`, with `@` characters (which may represent null bits) appearing in the file path. This error can prevent Emacs from properly installing or initializing packages.

### Fix:

1. Add the correct file path to your `~/.bashrc` (or equivalent shell configuration file) by setting the `INFOPATH` variable. This environment variable seems to override wherever Emacs is pulling the mangled `filenamep` value from. You can copy the correct path from the error message but **remove the `@` characters**:

   ```bash
   export INFOPATH=/scratch2/software/anaconda/envs/emacs/share/info
   ```

   (The path shown is, of course, just an example. Replace it with the path from your error message.)

2. Source your `.bashrc` to apply the change:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

3. Restart Emacs. The error should now be resolved.
